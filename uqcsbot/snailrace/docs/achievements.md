# Snailrace - Achievements
> 10th May 2023

The achievements section of the `snailrace` game is purely cosmetic. They act as
badges on your `/snailrace profile` with each achievement having **5 Lavels** 
with varying difficulty. All achievements should be theoretically possible and
achieveable with the exception of one the `Snail Mechanic` badge and its levels.

## Appearance

As mentioned before, achievements are purely cosmetic and appear as badges on
your `/snailrace profile`. Each achievement needs its own symbol, which can be
unicode, but must be distinct compared to other badges. They also need to 
display the level of the badge in the profile. Below is an example on how this
can be achieved:

```
    Snail Hoarder   [###  ]
    The Auctioneer  [##   ]
    Ripper Doc      [#    ]
```

> **Note:** No symbols have been chosen yet, not a priority and will be more 
>           than happy to let the community decide (if required).

There is a second way for the achievement to be displayed, this is when the
achievement is achieved in the first place. This will be broadcasted in the 
channel that the achievement was gained and will look like the following:

```
> **The Auctioneer `[###  ]`** 
>         Auction off 50 items. I didn't want that anyway.
